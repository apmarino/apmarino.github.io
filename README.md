This is an extremely simple blackjack game.

Type in a number to the input box, click 'bet', then click 'deal'.

You now have three options: Hit, Stand, and Doubledown.

Double down works! When you hit the Double Down button you will be given only one more card and double your bet against the dealer!


If your bank goes to 0, a modal will pop up and the 'Play again?' button will let you restart.
