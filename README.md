This is an extremely simple blackjack game.

Type in a number to the input box, click 'bet', then deal.

You now have three options: Hit, Stand, and Doubledown.

Double down works around half the time. When it doesn't, it will run multiple times, 'Bank' and 'current bet' will be NaN.I wouldn't click it.

If your bank goes to 0, a modal will pop up and the 'Play again?' button will let you restart.
